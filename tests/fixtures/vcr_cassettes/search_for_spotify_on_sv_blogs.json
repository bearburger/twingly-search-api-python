The Slackers release date is Feb 19th, 2016, and is also\u00a0being\u00a0released independently\u00a0on their own Special Potato label after a successful crowdfunding campaign on www.bigtun.es. \r\nThe album is being co-distributed in the\u00a0United States by Rare Breed Recording Co., in Europe by Brain Lab Groove, and in Japan by Just A Record. It will also be available online on the P+P Webstore, Spotify and Pandora. We are excited to be able to get involved! \r\nThose hard working purveyors of Jamaican Rock n\u2019\u00a0Roll\u00a0known as The Slackers, have been in existence for a \u00a0quarter of a century now. This band, which started out rehearsing in a dingy basement on the lower east side, has gone on to become a legendary touring group and has been\u00a0playing over a 100 concerts a year since\u00a01997. \r\nThe Slackers will be starting their 25th anniversary celebration with a new album.\u00a0If \u2018Jamaican Rock n\u2019 Roll\u2019 is The Slackers\u2019 trademark sound, this new album might be know as\u00a0\u2018Psychedelic Jamaican Rock N Roll.\u2019 \u00a0The influences of \u2018Pet Sounds era\u2019\u00a0Beach Boys, \u2018Sgt Pepper era\u2019 Beatles\u00a0and other 60\u2019s rockers are prominent in the blend. \r\nOver the course of the year, the band will continue the celebration by doing rotating blocks of tunes from all 15 of their original albums in their live sets and developing special theme shows.The Slackers are currently booking\u00a0dates\u00a0for 2016 in North America,\u00a0Europe, Japan and beyond for their 25th anniversary\u00a0tour, in support of their\u00a0new self-titled record.\u00a0They will also be taking part in\u00a0Flogging Molly\u2019s Salty Dog\u00a0Cruise,\u00a0Rebellion Festivals, and Boomtown Festival. \r\nThe first song released from the new album\u00a0is \u201cSpin I\u2019m In\u201d (listen below). About the song, Dave Hillyard said,\u00a0\u201cThe spin is your point of view and the spinning of the earth (time). On a layered album, its the simplest most direct tune. Just Vic\u2019s voice, a little country reggae rhythm and little snippets of horns, keys, and backing vocals for color.\u201d \r\n \r\nThe Slackers\u00a0Track Listing: \r\n1. The Boss \r\n2. By the Time I Get to Sleep \r\n3. Go Go Go! \r\n4. Working Overtime \r\n5. Spin I\u2019m In \r\n6. I Want to be Your Girl \r\n7. Pockets of A Rich Man \r\n8. Run Till We Can\u2019t Outrun \r\n9. Things I Can\u2019t Forget \r\n10. Truth Comes Knocking \r\n11. Chewing On A Face \r\n12.

That made using SoundCloud to find new music that fit your interests more difficult \u2013 and that\u2019s a problem for a service that\u2019s known to be\u00a0a place to discover emerging or under-the-radar talent. \r\nThe feature has long been\u00a0one of users\u2019 biggest requests. Before today, discovering new songs actually involved a fair amount of work. \r\n \r\nTo create your first SoundCloud station, users will pull up a menu after searching for a term, track, content stream, or your Collection, and then tap the \u201cStart Station\u201d option. Afterwards, that Station will remain a part of your Collection, along with your Likes and Playlists. The company also notes that there are today over 100 million tracks on its\u00a0service to choose from today. \r\nThe launch of Stations comes at a time when SoundCloud is trying to figure out ways to monetize its business. The company raised some \u20ac32 million in debt financing dating back to\u00a0early 2015, and confirmed more recently that it plans to roll out paid subscriptions and advertising across its global markets later this year. \r\nOf course, before SoundCloud can charge for a premium tier, it needs to\u00a0establish a baseline service where it\u2019s at least on par with the rest of the streaming music market. That could certainly include a radio feature like Stations \u2013 something that Pandora, Apple Music, Spotify, Play Music, and others,\u00a0offer. \r\nSoundCloud says the Stations feature is live now on both its iOS and Android applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImage 2016-02-01 at 10.54.16 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImage 2016-02-01 at 10.56.19 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niPhone6-_collection-copy1]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-02 17:32:30Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-02 17:34:30Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.h2ostandard.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[The H2O Standard]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>3</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Tech and Gadgets]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.hiphopillustrated.com/trev-rich-vapors</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Trev Rich \u2013 Vapors]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Trev Rich \u2013 Vapors\u00a0Share/Stream \u201cVapors\u201d on Sound Cloud:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/trevrichhd/vapors-prod-by-sharke\u00a0DIRECTED by Leland Schmidt\u00a0PRODUCED by Sharke\u00a0Music video by Trev Rich performing Vapors. \u00a9 SQUIZZY\u00a0The Way We Love EP AVAILABLE NOW:\u00a0iTunes: https://goo.gl/9Fv9Xz\u00a0Spotify: https://goo.gl/o2rRQL\u00a0Amazon: https://goo.gl/r4gr2W\u00a0www.iamtrevrich.com\u00a0www.twitter.com/TREVRICHHD\u00a0www.instagram.com/TREVRICHHD\u00a0www.youtube.com/TrevRichHDVideos \r\nThe post Trev Rich \u2013 Vapors appeared first on Hip Hop Illustrated.]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-02 17:09:42Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-02 17:32:30Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.hiphopillustrated.com/</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[Hip Hop Illustrated]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>5</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n  <tags>\r\n    <tag><![CDATA[Artist On The Rise]]></tag>\r\n  </tags>\r\n</post><post contentType=\"blog\">\r\n  <url>http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/article/Spotify-s-Top-10-most-streamed-tracks-6800980.php</url>\r\n  <title><![CDATA[Spotify's Top 10 most streamed tracks]]></title>\r\n  <summary><![CDATA[Justin Bieber, \"Love Yourself\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"Sorry\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"What Do You Mean?\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"Love Yourself\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"Sorry\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"What Do You Mean?\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nSnakehips, \"All My Friends\" (Sony Music Entertainment UK Limited)\r\n\r\n99 Souls, \"The Girl Is Mine featuring Destiny's Child & Brandy\" (Sony Music Entertainment UK Limited)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"Love Yourself\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"Sorry\" (Def Jam Recordings)\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber, \"What Do You Mean?\" (Def Jam Recordings)]]></summary>\r\n  <languageCode>en</languageCode>\r\n  <published>2016-02-02 17:09:23Z</published>\r\n  <indexed>2016-02-02 17:37:29Z</indexed>\r\n  <blogUrl>http://www.mysanantonio.com/entertainment/music-stage/collectionRss/Music-Stage-Simple-List-24676.php</blogUrl>\r\n  <blogName><![CDATA[Music & Stage Simple List]]></blogName>\r\n  <authority>4</authority>\r\n  <blogRank>1</blogRank>\r\n</post></twinglydata>", "encoding": "utf-8"}, "headers": {"Content-Length": "14248", "Set-Cookie": "SERVERID=web03; path=/", "Server": "nginx", "Connection": "keep-alive", "Cache-Control": "private", "Date": "Tue, 02 Feb 2016 17:58:33 GMT", "Content-Type": "text/xml; charset=utf-8"}, "status": {"message": "OK", "code": 200}, "url": "https://api.twingly.com/analytics/Analytics.ashx?tsTo=&searchpattern=spotify+page-size%3A10&ts=&xmloutputversion=2&key=<TWINGLY-API-KEY>&documentlang=sv"}, "recorded_at": "2016-02-02T17:58:32"}], "recorded_with": "betamax/0.5.1"}
